Emotion Detection System
Developed a robust emotion detection system using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy in classifying emotions from facial expressions.
Serialized model architecture to JSON and saved weights to HDF5 format for deployment and reuse.
